Urban Terror Bots

If you want to use theese bots with new weapons like Glock, Colt and Mac,
You have to download this repository as zip file and change extension from .zip to .pk3 and move it into q3ut4 folder inside your Urban Terror directory.
I also added support for new 19 maps.
Tested with Team Survivor Mode.

You can easly add bots by typing
 /exec bots
Maybe you will need to reload you map for enabling bots and then execing config again.
